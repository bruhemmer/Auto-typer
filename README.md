To edit what it auto types and if it repeats then continue reading.
To edit what it types simply right click and hit open with and then open with notepad.
Once in there you can change the speed and what it spells out.
to change the speed edit the (wscript.sleep 100) to your likings.
to edit/change what it spells change the (wshshell.sendkeys "I") fuction. it works by each lime being a letter so edit the letters.
and last but not least how to make it repeat, edit the (Dim x x=1 Do While x<>10). change the 10 in (x<>10)to how ever many times you want it to loop.
